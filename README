# Diabetes Prediction Project

This project aims to predict diabetes using machine learning algorithms such as SVM, Logistic Regression, and LightGBM. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is applied to improve model accuracy.

## Dataset
- **File**: `diabetes prediction.csv`
- The dataset contains various health parameters like glucose levels, BMI, age, etc.

## Project Structure
- `miniproject.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with data analysis, model training, and evaluation.
- `diabetes prediction.csv`: Dataset used for training and testing.
- `mp_conference paper.pdf`: Conference paper documenting the project findings.

## Models Used
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Logistic Regression (LR)
- Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM)

## Optimization Technique
- **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)**: Used to fine-tune model hyperparameters and improve performance.

## How to Run
1. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy sklearn lightgbm

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook miniproject.ipynb

3. Run all cells to train models and view results.

Results
Achieved improved accuracy using PSO.
Detailed metrics and visualizations are in the notebook.

Future Enhancements
Experimenting with deep learning models.
Integrating a web app for real-time predictions.
