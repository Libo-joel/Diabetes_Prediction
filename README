# Diabetes Prediction Project

This project aims to predict diabetes using machine learning algorithms such as SVM, Logistic Regression, and LightGBM. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is applied to improve model accuracy.

## Dataset
- **File**: `diabetes prediction.csv`
- The dataset contains various health parameters like glucose levels, BMI, age, etc.

## Project Structure
- `miniproject.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with data analysis, model training, and evaluation.
- `diabetes prediction.csv`: Dataset used for training and testing.
- `mp_conference paper.pdf`: Conference paper documenting the project findings.

## Models Used
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Logistic Regression (LR)
- Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM)

## Optimization Technique
- **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)**: Used to fine-tune model hyperparameters and improve performance.

## How to Run
1. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy sklearn lightgbm
